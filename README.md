# DNX Solutions: Hands-On Learning Challenge Repository

## Our Mission: Making Complexity Simple Through Practical Learning

Welcome to the DNX Solutions Learning Labs. As an AWS Premier Consulting Partner, our mission is to solve complex challenges by building innovative, cloud-native solutions on AWS. This repository is an extension of our core value of **"Knowledge Sharing."** It contains a collection of hands-on technical challenges designed to build practical skills in cloud computing, DevOps, and modern application development within the AWS ecosystem.

Each lab is rooted in real-world business scenarios, reflecting our belief that technology is a driver for business transformation. We focus on building solutions that embody **operational excellence, efficiency, and strategic value**‚Äîprinciples that guide our work.

## Our Guiding Principles

### Solving Real Business Problems on AWS

Every lab starts with a tangible business problem, mirroring our customer-obsessed, "Working Backwards" approach. The goal is not just to build technology, but to deliver a clear, measurable business outcome.

### Mastering the AWS Cloud-Native Stack

Our labs are proudly focused on the AWS platform. We explore the depth and breadth of AWS services to build solutions that are scalable, secure, resilient, and cost-effective, adhering to the principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

### Driving Operational Excellence

We believe in automation, modern DevOps practices, and creating efficient, manageable systems. These labs are designed to instill the discipline required to not only deploy applications but to operate them safely and effectively at scale.

## Available Labs

### üèóÔ∏è Lab 1: Deploying a Well-Architected 3-Tier Application on AWS

**Category:** Application Architecture & Deployment
**Difficulty:** Foundational

Deploy and manage a complete 3-tier web application using various AWS-native deployment strategies.

**The Business Problem:**
A startup needs to launch a scalable, secure, and cost-effective user registration system. The architecture must support future growth and be easy to manage by a small DevOps team.

**Solution Approaches on AWS:**

  - **IaaS:** Traditional deployment on Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling Groups.
  - **Containers:** Containerized deployment using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with AWS Fargate.
  - **Serverless:** A fully serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB.
  - **PaaS:** Platform-as-a-Service deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

**Skills Developed:**

  - AWS infrastructure provisioning (VPC, IAM, S3).
  - Full-stack application architecture on AWS.
  - Infrastructure as Code (AWS CloudFormation or CDK).
  - CI/CD automation with AWS CodePipeline.
  - Database management with Amazon RDS and DynamoDB.
